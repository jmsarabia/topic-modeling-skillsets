# topic-modeling-skillsets
Mapping skills extracted from job postings in 2023 for data science positions through topic modeling with LDA, Top2Vec, and BERTopic

## Description

topic-modeling-skillsets is a specialized research project designed to automate the extraction of skills from job postings and attribute them to specific data science related positions through NLP techniques. By employing three different topic modeling approaches — LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation), Top2Vec, and BERTopic — this project offers a comprehensive toolkit for understanding job market demands and the specific skills associated with various positions.


## Installation

topic-modeling-skillsets requires separate setup procedures for LDA, Top2Vec, and BERTopic due to their distinct dependencies and configurations. Follow the appropriate setup instructions for the package you intend to use

### Bertopic

Before proceeding with package-specific setups, ensure you have Python 3.8 or newer installed. Clone the repository and install common dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/topic-modeling-skillsets.git
cd topic-modeling-skillsets
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Prepare the dataset in the same format as the ai-jobs_data_science_job.csv. While this

## Acknowledgments
Recognition to the developers of the LDA, Top2Vec, and BERTopic libraries.
Gratitude towards the following Kaggle for dataset provision.

## Results
The Sarabia_Job_Description_Report.pdf outlines the process, results, and additional findings, including differences between the three topic modeling algorithms.
